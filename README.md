## Controls
Up-arrow or space-bar to jump over spikes, avoid crashing into walls, and interact with orbs to jump in mid-air.


## Level information
Currently, there are 2 levels out of the box, both made using [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), a 2d tile based level editor.

[Go to code](/main.py)


## Getting Started

Download zip, then run main.py

Make sure you are running at least Python 3.9 and Pygame 2.0 on your machine.

To install Pygame module, run the following from your command prompt/PowerShell on Windows or the equivalent program on OS X:
```
pip install pygame
```

Then in your python file:
```python
import pygame
```
if you don't recognize anything up to here, read a tutorial for [Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) and [Pygame](https://coderslegacy.com/python/python-pygame-tutorial/)
